# Erdos-May22-LunarOutpost
A repository for a project in completion of the May 2022 Erdos Data Science Bootcamp

The complete final project can be viewed on my team member's Github at [https://github.com/wrlaxboy151/may22-lunar-outpost](https://github.com/wrlaxboy151/may22-lunar-outpost)

In this project, we created a model that would predict which films would be nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the Oscars.
