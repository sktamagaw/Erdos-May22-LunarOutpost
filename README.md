# Erdos-May22-LunarOutpost
A repository for a project in completion of the May 2022 Erdos Data Science Bootcamp

This project was completed in conjunction with [William Reese](https://github.com/wrlaxboy151), [Charles Ruggiero](https://github.com/ruggiec), and [Nathan Schley](https://github.com/Finer-Things).

The complete final project can be viewed on my team member's Github at [https://github.com/wrlaxboy151/may22-lunar-outpost](https://github.com/wrlaxboy151/may22-lunar-outpost)

In this project, we created a model that would predict which films would be nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the Oscars 2023, using data scraped from IMDb.  We created a weighted voting model that incorporated a random forest, a K-neighbors classifier, a support vector classifier, and a logistic regression classifier.  The features that we found useful to build our model were genre, country of origin, month of original release, US certificates (ratings such as PG or R), critical review scores, and whether or not the producers, directors, and/or production companies had been nominated for an Oscar in the past.

<!--
This repository is organized as follows:
- Data: A folder with the cleaned data we scraped, as well as the code I wrote for cleaning the data
- EDA: A folder for my initial exploratory data analysis.
- Initial models: a folder for my initial models that I trained
- Final model: contains our final model
